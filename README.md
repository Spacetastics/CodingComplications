# CodingComplications
 My own solutions for problems on different competitive programming websites as a learning programmer. Feel free to use my code if you're also in the learning process and get stuck :)
 
Note: I like to keep things organized so all of my programs are in packages. Code Forces will fail your program if you submit it with the package not commented out.
